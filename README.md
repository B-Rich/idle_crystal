--------------

Civ building idle game. From stone age to whole universe civilization.

* ncurses interface
* optional web interface
* multiple threads: backend, interface, web

Roadmap/TODO
------------

[ ] building interface - show cost,production,efectiveness
[ ] easily definiable resources and production buildings
[ ] refactor to change names to be more meaningful
[ ] convert production tabs to allow add other type of tabs like research
[ ] research tab with age technologies and improve technologies
[ ] age technology allow to build more advanced buildings
[ ] improve technology increase production of various buildings
[ ] convertor buildings - use small amount of resources to create another type of
    resource
[ ] convertor buildings - auto reduce utilization to not allow of negative
    production of resource type
[ ] simplified exploration, warfare    
[ ] everything should be additive if possible, some more efficient buildings will
    convert
[ ] better representation of very big numbers, scientific 2x10^34

* genetic - nanotechnology, fusion, gene optimization, high pressure (underwater),
  life extension, short space exploration
* diamons - matter manipulation, smart materials, theory of everything,
  space propulsion, human-machine interface
* space - faster than light, matrix-like connection, mind backup
* galactic - small stellar manipulation, full star energy utilization, whole galaxy
  should be explorable, another galaxy explored, stargates
